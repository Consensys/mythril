// inheritable "property" contract that enables methods to be protected by requiring the acquiescence of either a
// single, or, crucially, each of a number of, designated owners.
// usage:
// use modifiers onlyowner (just own owned) or onlymanyowners(hash), whereby the same hash must be provided by
// some number (specified in constructor) of the set of owners (specified in the constructor, modifiable) before the
// interior is executed.

  // this contract only has six types of events: it can accept a confirmation, in which case
  // we record owner and operation (hash) alongside it.

  // some others are in the case of an owner changing.

  event OwnerRemoved(address oldOwner);

  // the last one is emitted if the required signatures change

  event Deposit(address _from, uint value);
  // Single transaction going out of the wallet (record who signed for it, how much, and to whom it's going).
  event SingleTransact(address owner, uint value, address to, bytes data, address created);
  // Multi-sig transaction going out of the wallet (record who signed for it last, the operation hash, how much, and to whom it's going).
  event MultiTransact(address owner, bytes32 operation, uint value, address to, bytes data, address created);
  // Confirmation still needed for a transaction.
