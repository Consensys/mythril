Mythril is a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It uses concolic analysis, taint analysis and control flow checking to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities. The analysis is based on [laser-ethereum](https://github.com/b-mueller/laser-ethereum), a symbolic execution library for EVM bytecode.

## Installation and setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril/
$ docker build mythril
```

Install from Pypi:

## Acknowledgements

- JSON RPC library is adapted from [ethjsonrpc](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethjsonrpc) (it doesn't seem to be maintained anymore, and I needed to make some changes to it).

- The signature data in `signatures.json` was initially obtained from the [Ethereum Function Signature Database](https://www.4byte.directory).

- Many features, bugfixes and analysis modules have been added by [contributors](https://github.com/b-mueller/mythril/graphs/contributors).
