==== Dependence on predictable environment variable ====
Type: Warning
Contract: WeakRandom
Function name: _function_0xe9874106
PC address: 1285

==== Ether send ====
Type: Warning
Contract: WeakRandom
Function name: _function_0xe9874106
PC address: 1285
In the function '_function_0xe9874106' a non-zero amount of Ether is sent to an address taken from storage slot 0.
There is a check on storage index 0. This storage slot can be written to by calling the function 'fallback'.

There is a check on storage index 1. This storage slot can be written to by calling the function 'fallback'.

==== Exception state ====
Type: Informational
Contract: WeakRandom
Function name: fallback
PC address: 356
A reachable exception (opcode 0xfe) has been detected. This can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. This is acceptable in most situations. Note however that assert() should only be used to check invariants. Use require() for regular input checking.
