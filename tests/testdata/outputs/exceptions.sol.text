==== Exception state ====
Type: Informational

Function name: _function_0x546455b5
PC address: 446
A reachable exception (opcode 0xfe) has been detected. This can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. This is acceptable in most situations. Note however that assert() should only be used to check invariants. Use require() for regular input checking.
