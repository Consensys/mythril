==== Exception state ====
SWC ID: 110
Type: Informational
Contract: Unknown
Function name: assert3(uint256)
PC address: 446
Estimated Gas Usage: 206 - 301
A reachable exception (opcode 0xfe) has been detected. This can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.
