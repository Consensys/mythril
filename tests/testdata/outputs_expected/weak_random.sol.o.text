==== Dependence on predictable environment variable ====
Type: Warning
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xe9874106
PC address: 1285
In the function `_function_0xe9874106` the following predictable state variables are used to determine Ether recipient:
- block.coinbase

--------------------

==== Ether send ====
Type: Warning
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xe9874106
PC address: 1285
In the function `_function_0xe9874106` a non-zero amount of Ether is sent to an address taken from storage slot 0.
There is a check on storage index 0. This storage slot can be written to by calling the function `fallback`.

There is a check on storage index 1. This storage slot can be written to by calling the function `fallback`.
There is a check on storage index 1. This storage slot can be written to by calling the function `fallback`.
--------------------

==== Exception state ====
Type: Informational
Contract: Unknown
Function name: fallback
PC address: 356
A reachable exception (opcode 0xfe) has been detected. This can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. This is acceptable in most situations. Note however that `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.

==== Transaction order dependence ====
Type: Warning
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xe9874106
PC address: 1285
A possible transaction order independence vulnerability exists in function _function_0xe9874106. The value or direction of the call statement is determined from a tainted storage location
