==== Message call to external contract ====
SWC ID: 107
Type: Informational
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0x5a6814ec
PC address: 661
Estimated Gas Usage: 643 - 1254
This contract executes a message call to to another contract. Make sure that the called contract is trusted and does not execute user-supplied code.

==== Unchecked CALL return value ====
SWC ID: 104
Type: Informational
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0x5a6814ec
PC address: 666
Estimated Gas Usage: 1352 - 35963
The return value of an external call is not checked. Note that execution continue even if the called contract throws.

==== Message call to external contract ====
SWC ID: 107
Type: Warning
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xd24b08cc
PC address: 779
Estimated Gas Usage: 687 - 1298
This contract executes a message call to an address found at storage slot 1. This storage slot can be written to by calling the function `_function_0x2776b163`. Generally, it is not recommended to call user-supplied addresses using Solidity's call() construct. Note that attackers might leverage reentrancy attacks to exploit race conditions or manipulate this contract's state.

==== Transaction order dependence ====
SWC ID: 114
Type: Warning
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xd24b08cc
PC address: 779
Estimated Gas Usage: 687 - 1298
Possible transaction order dependence vulnerability: The value or direction of the call statement is determined from a tainted storage location

==== Unchecked CALL return value ====
SWC ID: 104
Type: Informational
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xd24b08cc
PC address: 784
Estimated Gas Usage: 1396 - 36007
The return value of an external call is not checked. Note that execution continue even if the called contract throws.

==== Message call to external contract ====
SWC ID: 107
Type: Informational
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xe11f493e
PC address: 858
Estimated Gas Usage: 709 - 1320
This contract executes a message call to to another contract. Make sure that the called contract is trusted and does not execute user-supplied code.
--------------------

==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107
Type: Warning
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xe11f493e
PC address: 869
Estimated Gas Usage: 709 - 1320
The contract account state is changed after an external call. Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.

SWC ID: 107
Type: Warning
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0xe1d10f79
PC address: 912
Estimated Gas Usage: 335 - 616
This contract executes a message call to an address provided as a function argument. Generally, it is not recommended to call user-supplied addresses using Solidity's call() construct. Note that attackers might leverage reentrancy attacks to exploit race conditions or manipulate this contract's state.
