# Analysis results for test-filename.sol

## Exception state
- SWC ID: 110
- Type: Informational
- Contract: Unknown
- Function name: `_function_0x546455b5`
- PC address: 446
- Estimated Gas Usage: 148 - 148

### Description

A reachable exception (opcode 0xfe) has been detected. This can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.
