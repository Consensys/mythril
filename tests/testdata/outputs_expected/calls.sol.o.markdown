- SWC ID: 107
- Type: Informational
- Contract: Unknown
- Function name: `_function_0x5a6814ec`
- PC address: 661
- Estimated Gas Usage: 284

### Description

This contract executes a message call to to another contract. Make sure that the called contract is trusted and does not execute user-supplied code.

## Unchecked CALL return value
- SWC ID: 104
- Type: Informational
- Contract: Unknown
- Function name: `_function_0x5a6814ec`
- PC address: 666
- Estimated Gas Usage: 993

### Description

The return value of an external call is not checked. Note that execution continue even if the called contract throws.

## Message call to external contract
- SWC ID: 107
- Type: Warning
- Contract: Unknown
- Function name: `_function_0xd24b08cc`
- PC address: 779
- Estimated Gas Usage: 328

### Description

This contract executes a message call to an address found at storage slot 1. This storage slot can be written to by calling the function `_function_0x2776b163`. Generally, it is not recommended to call user-supplied addresses using Solidity's call() construct. Note that attackers might leverage reentrancy attacks to exploit race conditions or manipulate this contract's state.

- SWC ID: 114
- Type: Warning
- Contract: Unknown
- Function name: `_function_0xd24b08cc`
- PC address: 779
- Estimated Gas Usage: 328

### Description

Possible transaction order dependence vulnerability: The value or direction of the call statement is determined from a tainted storage location

## State change after external call
- SWC ID: 107
- Type: Warning
- Contract: Unknown
- Function name: `_function_0xe11f493e`
- PC address: 869
- Estimated Gas Usage: 350

### Description

The contract account state is changed after an external call. Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.
