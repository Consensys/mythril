==== Exception state ====
Type: Informational
Contract: Unknown
Function name: _function_0x57d4021b
PC address: 1653
A reachable exception (opcode 0xfe) has been detected. This can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. This is acceptable in most situations. Note however that `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.
