The return value of a message call is not checked.
External calls return a boolean value. If the callee contract halts with an exception, 'false' is returned and execution continues in the caller. It is usually recommended to wrap external calls into a require statement to prevent unexpected states.

Use of callcode is deprecated.
The callcode method executes code of another contract in the context of the caller account. Due to a bug in the implementation it does not persist sender and value over the call. It was therefore deprecated and may be removed in the future. Use the delegatecall method instead.

==== Delegatecall Proxy To User-Supplied Address ====

The contract implements a delegatecall proxy to a user supplied address.
The smart contract executes delegate call to a user supplied address. Note that callers can execute arbitrary contracts and that the callee contract can access the storage of the calling contract.

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.
